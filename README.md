Hi,
In this file I practice animations of all kinds.
The current state is:

-cookie alert animation
-CD spinning animation still infinite.
-hacking text effect
-hover effect on text
-simple hover card effect on img

Ultimately, the plate is supposed to spin itself, but under the influence of scroll, slow down or change the direction of rotation.

Regards, Tymek
